A starter kit for making immersive games in Unity.

Currently features the base movement system and a sample scene, though a huge code cleanup and modular item system are on their way

to install:
- once the project is created, click the white tab at the top labelled "Window" and navigate down to "Package manager"
- click the + button on the top left, then "add from git url"
- paste https://github.com/Gamekour/LucidityDrive.git into the field, if it asks about restarting hit yes
- on the bottom left of unity, find the packages folder
- open lucidity drive folder, then samples, and drag the scene (LucidityDriveSampleScene) into the your assets folder on the left
- go to the top of unity, open the tab called "Tools", and then click on automatic setup - it should create a window, click the button then close the window
- go to your assets folder and double click the scene you dragged into it
- press play - if everything works then you're ready to start making your game!
(if you want to hide your cursor, just click on the game window while playing and press tab. tab again restores cursor)

And that's it - more comprehensive documentation will be made in the future, but I figured I'd open the code up early on for anyone interested.
